In React, components are the building blocks of user interfaces. They are reusable pieces of code that can be combined to create complex UIs.

Here are the key points about components:

Components are created by developers.
They can wrap HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
They allow you to split complex UIs into smaller, more manageable parts.
Components can be reused in different places of the UI.
Related code can be stored together within components.
Components promote separation of concerns, where different components handle different parts of the UI.
Note: This concept of components is also used in other popular front-end frameworks and even in mobile development frameworks.
